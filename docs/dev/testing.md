# Testing

AIS uses two main test layers:

- unit tests
- integration tests

Run the full suite with:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Test Layout

```text
tests/
├── fixtures/
│   └── golden_cases.py
├── integration/
│   └── test_golden_path.py
└── unit/
```

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are the fast layer.

They usually:

- mock repositories
- mock collaborating services where needed
- test one service or helper in isolation

Examples:

- classification logic
- rule resolution orchestration
- tariff resolution behavior
- fact normalization
- expression evaluation
- audit reconstruction

## Integration Tests

Integration tests exercise the live FastAPI app and seeded database together.

They do not mock the full stack.

Examples:

- `tests/integration/test_golden_path.py`

Those tests send real HTTP requests to the application through the test client and verify end-to-end outcomes.

## Golden Test Cases

The canonical golden assessment fixtures live in:

- `tests/fixtures/golden_cases.py`

These are the acceptance-style cases used to validate real business outcomes.

They represent realistic:

- products
- corridors
- facts
- expected outcomes

Because `golden_cases.py` is a locked reference file, do not edit it casually.
If you truly need a new golden acceptance case, get explicit review before changing that file.

## How To Add A New Test Case

For normal feature work:

1. add or update a unit test in `tests/unit/`
2. add an integration test in `tests/integration/` if the behavior crosses service or HTTP boundaries
3. if the change needs a new acceptance-style scenario, coordinate before touching `tests/fixtures/golden_cases.py`

When adding a new failure path:

- assert the specific machine-readable failure code
- do not only assert `eligible is False`

## What `@pytest.mark.integration` Means

`@pytest.mark.integration` marks tests that require the integrated application stack and seeded database state.

These tests are slower and more environment-dependent than unit tests.

In AIS, that generally means:

- live FastAPI app
- real database connection
- seeded reference dataset

## Expression Evaluator Safety Test

The expression evaluator includes a safety-focused unit test that checks the source file for disallowed dynamic execution.

It is there to guard against:

- `eval()`
- `exec()`
- standalone `compile()`

This matters because AIS executes rule logic from stored expressions and must do so through a safe parser rather than arbitrary Python execution.

## Current Coverage

Current test count:

- `61` unit tests
- `6` integration tests

Treat those numbers as a baseline to maintain or improve when you add behavior.

## What New Code Must Be Tested

At minimum:

- every new service method
- every new failure code path
- every schema edge case that can break route validation
- any change to expression evaluation behavior
- any change to audit persistence or replay

If your change affects the deterministic engine output, it should almost always have:

- a focused unit test
- and, when appropriate, a golden-path integration test
